Overview
--------

The API documentation covers the following modules:

- **autoencoder**  
  Contains classes and functions for building, training, and evaluating autoencoder models used for anomaly detection.

- **forecasting**  
  Provides the forecasting models and utilities to predict remaining useful life (RUL) and other time series forecasting tasks.

- **preprocessing**  
  Includes data preprocessing functions such as feature selection, normalization, and sequence preparation.

- **anomaly_detection**  
  Implements anomaly scoring, detection logic, and thresholding mechanisms.

- **visualization**  
  Functions and classes for plotting, visualizing model performance, and analyzing results.

- **utils**  
  Utility functions used across the package for logging, configuration, and other helpers.

Usage
-----

Each module contains detailed docstrings describing class and function parameters, return types, and usage examples. Refer to the specific module pages for in-depth information.
