Overview
--------

The examples range from simple scripts showing how to run the core functions with default settings to more advanced use cases where you can customize parameters, extend models, or integrate with other systems.

- **Basic Usage**  
  Walks through the steps to load sample CMAPSS data, train a forecasting model, and detect anomalies with minimal configuration.

- **Advanced Usage**  
  Covers customization of models, fine-tuning hyperparameters, setting up different anomaly scoring metrics, and exporting results for further analysis.

Getting Started
---------------

You can find the example scripts in the `examples/` directory of the repository. Each example is fully commented and comes with instructions on required inputs and expected outputs.

Running the examples requires that TurboGuard and all dependencies are installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment for this.
